# PATENT SPECIFICATION: TRYONME SYSTEM (EPCT/WIPO)

**Patent Title:** SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BIOMETRIC FASHION INTELLIGENCE, AUTOMATED PRODUCTION (CAP), AND SMART CLOSET MANAGEMENT.

**International Classification:** G06Q 30/06, G06F 3/01, A41H 3/00.

## CLAIMS

1. **A System for Personalized Fashion Generation**, comprising:
   a. A biometric data acquisition module (Tryon Questionnaire + Computer Vision) capturing weight, height, and specific body morphology via scalar reference (A4 paper).
   b. A generative design engine (FGT) utilizing tracked user interactions (clicks/likes) to generate unique garment mockups in real-time.
   c. A biometric authentication module (AVBET) utilizing dual-factor validation via Iris Scanning and Voiceprint analysis for transaction authorization.

2. **The method of Claim 1**, wherein the **Checkout Process** triggers a simultaneous "Just-In-Time" manufacturing order (LiveIt Factory) and a digital asset registration in a cloud-based inventory system (Smart Closet).

3. **The CAP (Computer Aided Production) Subsystem**, characterized by the automatic generation of industrial patterns (.dxf) derived directly from the generative mockup selected by the user, without human intervention.

4. **The AVBET Payment Protocol**, wherein the authorization token is generated solely from the unique combination of the user's biological iris hash and a specific voice passphrase, eliminating the need for traditional card details stored on the device.

5. **The Smart Closet Module**, configured to track garment lifecycle, suggesting "AutoDonate" actions for items with low usage frequency, thereby closing the sustainability loop.

6. **The PAU (Personalized Algorithm Unit)**, a recommendation engine that dynamically adjusts the shop front based on real-time FGT (Fashion Global Trends) data scraped from top search engine results (e.g., Google Top-20) mixed with the user's biometric profile.

7. **Ultimátum Workflow**, a unified process flow linking: Data Entry -> Biometric Avatar Creation -> Generative Shopping -> Biometric Payment -> Automated Manufacturing -> Logistics -> Digital Wardrobe Management -> Circular Economy Exit (Donation).

*(Claims 8-22 reserved for specific technical implementations of the neural networks and printing hardware interfaces)*.
